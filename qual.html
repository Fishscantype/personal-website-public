                        These are the programming languages I am most familiar with as these are languages used throughout my curriculum thus far at Texas A&M. Other languages I am familiar with but have not used much of include Rust, Scheme, SQL, JavaScript, and CSS.

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p>My primary areas of interest within Computer Science are Mathematics and Analysis. I enjoy problem solving, both on a team and on my own. I am interested in cryptography and algorithms as well. I am a member of the <a class="embed"href="https://acpc-ucd.com/index.html">Aggie Competitive Coding Club</a>, which I find very fulfilling. Solving problems usually consists of analyzing a word problem to understand the mathematical/logical principles underneath, then implementing a solution that runs within the time allotted. This gives me an outlet to practice my problem solving skills as well as familiarize myself with data structures and strategies to achieve the efficient implementations required.</p>
