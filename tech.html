                    <h2>Bismarck</h2>
                    <p>The first project I completed was a command-line based game built in python. This was a project completed for a Highschool Computer Science class I took my senior year. The game takes aspects from both battleship and wordle, combining the two to make an odd but fun crossword puzzle. The player guesses a location and a letter, giving you information about the space you guessed and the spaces around it.</p>

                    <p>This project was another command-line based game, this time built in c++. The goal of the game is to navigate the game board, avoiding obstacles and monsters to reach the key then ultimately the door to the next level. The game featured a simple enemy ai and level selection from a levels folder.</p>

                    <p>The final project of a Computer Science class I took spring of 2024 was constructing a replica of Wordle. The game was written in Java and used JavaFX to create the UI. The project contained all features and mechanics of Wordle, such as the  dynamically colored  keyboard and statistics, as well as additional features such as save file selection and game logs. The result was a rather fun project to build and play.</p>

                    <p>This project is still a work in progress, but one I hope to complete soon. The goal for this project is to create an effective QR code based inventory system. This project was designed for my mother who is a home stager, and wants a quick and easy way to track where each piece of furniture in her inventory is located at all times. Similar systems exist for this exact market, but they are rather expensive. This project will feature QR code reading, easy input of data, and allow users to set up shopping carts of available inventory to be used in an upcoming house. Using QR code stickers and a web application, I hope to create a useful and economical tool to track home staging inventory.</p>
